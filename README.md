# ProjectC
Repository of "ProjectC" for the event Code for Cause 2020 (Kathford).

Sorry for the overall unmanaged files, please firstly have a running web server(XAMPP preferred), with running Apache, and MySQL modules. 
Firstly, move the overall files to the xampp folder's htdocs subfolder (Create a new folder inside the htdocs folder and move the files into that folder for easy management).
After that, create a database named "visualizer_19" (go to the admin action section of MySQL module), and import the "visualizer_19.sql" file into the database.
Then run the index.php file, and analyze the page. The project demonstration video can come in handy.


Considering that file directory of index.php is as:
C://xampp/htdocs/newfolder/index.php
We run the file in the browser by inputting the address:
localhost/newfolder/index.php
